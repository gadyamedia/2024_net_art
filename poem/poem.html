    <h1>Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</h1>
    <p><strong>BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</strong></p>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Shall I compare thee to a summer’s day?<br>
        Thou art more <em>lovely</em> and more temperate:<br>
        Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,&nbsp;<br>
        And summer’s lease hath all too short a date;
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
        And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;<br>
        And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
        By chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
    </p>
    <p>
        But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
        Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;<br>
        Nor shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,<br>
        When in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:
    </p>
    <p>
        So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,<br>
        So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.
