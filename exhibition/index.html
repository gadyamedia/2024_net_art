          My exhibition of net art explores the net art of 1990-2000, a time period of the internet where it was less polished (compared to today), and creativity flourished within its constraints. It was a fascinating chapter in the history of net art, described as a “radical” time for the World Wide Web. During this time, personal computers and the web were new, so the art was primitive compared to today—but that is the beauty of this era. Early net artists were able to take minimal tools and create remarkable works. The pieces in my exhibition showcase how basic yet creative the early internet was compared to today.
